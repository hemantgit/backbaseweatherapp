        <h1>Welcome</h1>
        <p>This app is developed for an assessment given by Backbase. This screen serves as a quick
            help-file. The CSS of this file is generated from scss files, and based on a Grid system
            that I created to use on a regular basis.</p>

<section class="bookmark">
    <div class="column">
        <h2>The bookmark screens</h2>
        <p>This screen has 2 views: the listview, which is a list of all bookmarked locations and
            the map, which shows a map with all the bookmarked locations.</p>
        <h3>Bookmark list</h3>
        <p>You can click on a location to see the weatherforecast. You can also click at the right
            on the cross to delete the bookmark.</p>
        <h3>Map</h3>
        <p>The map is a simple map where you can see markers for each bookmark. Press and hold on a
            spot on the map or click a marker to view the weather forecast of that location. Place a
            marker by clicking on the bottom button and clicking on the map. </p>

<section class="location">
    <div class="column">
        <h2>The location screen / forecast</h2>
        <p>This screen has 2 ways of working. Either you navigate here directly from menu. In that
            case the app will try to get the users last known location and show the weather from
            that location. The user can also get to here by clicking any of the bookmarks in the
            bookmark screens.</p>
        <h3>Bookmark icon</h3>
        <p>The bookmark icon in the right top can be clicked to add or delete any location to the
            bookmarks. This also includes the last known location.</p>
        <h3>Why is the rain chance always 0?</h3>
        <p>Openweathermap has a fantastic API but it doesn't seem to have predictions about the
            chance of rain. This might be retrieved from other open APIs, but for now I left it on
            0.</p>
