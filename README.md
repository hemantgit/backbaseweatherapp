# Backbase Weather app
Weather app assignment for Backbase

## Extra's
* Created some tests. As it was not part of the assignment and I wasn't completly free this weekend, I didn't do full TDD. I just wrote some to show you I am capable of this.
* Last known location can be used to get forecast from and bookmarked as location.

## Disclaimer
So I had quite a tight schedule this weekend as Maria might have told you already. You might have already cloned the repo or seen that I am still working on it passed the deadline. If you think this is cheating, feel free to check out the last commit on sunday :). I just can't let go of the project just yet: having fun tweaking te last bits.

Another thing: the first commits were done by me not having my profile set yet. Github gave me the name Cris (I normally use Gitlab).
